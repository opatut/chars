Chars (working title)
=====================
- MRPG
- multiple characters per player
- character may change to different player based on respect
- Stealth / rough terrain race elements

Description
-------------

There is a huge world. You start as a single character. You can move around, interact with NPCs and Players (though players are not marked as such and NPCs are pretty vivid, doing stuff, interacting with each other). You can explore the world, find treasures, fight monsters and everything you do in normal RPGs. There are also quests, but players can create quests as well on their own characters. 

You gain overall EXP and character EXP, as well as health and all this stuff. You may train spells and abilities.

You gain NPC-per-NPC attraction/respect/honour. At some point another character in the world will change sides and follow you. You now control this character as well. If you do not interact the world with your character he might as well stop to follow you and become an NPC.


Thoughts
--------
If your ownly character leaves you or dies, you are able to create a new one.

=> Over time more and more characters join the world.

When a character dies, he will be reverted to the state he was in while using his last soul stone.
